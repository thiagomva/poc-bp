            <FaqItem question="What is BitPatron?">
                <p>A decentralized membership platform that gives creators the ability to monetize their passion/work with Bitcoin, or other payment gateways. The business model is decentralized and designed to keep maximum control of content, followers and paid subscription with the content creator. Unlike other platforms, here you can express your voice, without being controlled by big corporates.</p>

            <FaqItem question="What is Bitcoin &amp; why should I care?">
                <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As a decentralized virtual currency, BTC is a fast, cheap and secure way to transmit value internationally by using online devices. Anyone with internet access can participate in the network. &nbsp;With Bitcoin, creators can accept payments without needing the permission of any third parties. &nbsp;When you start using Bitcoin, you are helping shape the future of free speech, no creator will fear payment censorship, since it's not even possible.</p>
                <p>To understand more about Bitcoin, we recommend the following guide: <a href="https://www.bitwala.com/academy/">https://www.bitwala.com/academy/</a></p>

            <FaqItem question="What is Blockstack?">
                <p>BitPatron is built on top of Blockstack, allowing us to provide decentralized encrypted content storage. Blockstack is a new internet for decentralized apps that you access through the Blockstack Browser. With Blockstack, there is a new world of apps that let you own your data and maintain your privacy, security and freedom.</p>
                <p>Almost everything is transparent for end-users, but if you want to understand how it works behind, please refer to: <a href="https://medium.com/bitpatron/the-business-model-behind-bitpatron-72599c441115">https://medium.com/bitpatron/the-business-model-behind-bitpatron-72599c441115</a></p>

            <FaqItem question="Can content creators be censored/banned from BitPatron?">
                <p>BitPatron is moderated, according to our community guidelines. Content creators that are violating terms of service and community guidelines will be removed from BitPatron's frontend. However, BitPatron just controls the frontend and therefore even in the case of a removal, it won’t impact content storage, access to supporter information and payment subscription. Once banned, in theory, content creators can use a third party frontend or create their own frontend, since their data was never with us in the first place. All content and necessary data to give access to their patrons is stored at Blockstack's decentralized storage, controlled by the content creator.</p>

            <FaqItem question="Will BitPatron add credit card payment processors?">
                <p>Yes, we plan to add multiple payment gateways as an alternative for Bitcoin, consisting of various traditional providers directly linked to the content creator’s accounts, thus the content creator doesn’t rely on any powerful payment provider, nor on BitPatron for payments.</p>

            </FaqItem>
